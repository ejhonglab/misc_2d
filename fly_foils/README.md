### How to make a fly foil

#### Materials
- (Size?) weigh boat
  - (Optional) ~51mm diameter Petri dish half to trace out a circle.
- At least a 10 cm square of 1/8" acrylic
- Epoxy (model no?)
- 8-12 1/4", nickle-plated, neodymium magnets (model no?)
- 3/4" ID, 15/16" OD silicone O-ring [9396K29 (mcmaster?)] "116 width"
- Fly foil steel material? Machining instructions?

#### Instructions
1. Lasercut acrylic base from `fly_foil_base.dxf`

2. Cut circle from flat portion of a large weigh boat. Just needs to be at least
   a bit bigger than the interior circle of the base.

3. Cut a space about 7-8mm in diameter in the center of the weigh boat circle.
   This will be for the steel fly foil.

4. Cut out one of the machined steel fly foils, leaving enough space around it
   so it can overlap with the weigh boat circle.

5. Place steel fly foil in under and in the center of weigh boat material, so
   that any curve to the steel has its concave side down. Place a little epoxy
   around the overlapping portion of the steel fly foil, and tape down /
   compress the weight boat material onto the steel. Let the epoxy cure.

6. Press O-ring into interior circle of the base, ideally so it is protruding a
   little bit, uniformly, on one side.

7. Epoxy the weigh boat plastic + steel foil assembly onto this side, applying
   pressure with weights or a clamp until the epoxy cures, so the O-ring is
   under compression in the finished foil fixture.

8. On the same side, space half of your magnets out about a ~80mm circle,
   centered on the center of the base. Try to place all of the magnets in the
   same orientation. Epoxy them in place. Let epoxy cure (takes a few hours).

10. Flip assembly over. Apply epoxy around all of the interfaces in the center.
    Be careful not to get any too close to the fly-shaped cutout in the very
    center.

11. Epoxy the remaining magnets above those placed previously. Let epoxy cure.

A lot of the details aren't too important, but I found this makes a nice foil.
